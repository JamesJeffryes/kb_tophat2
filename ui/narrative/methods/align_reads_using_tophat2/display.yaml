parameters :
    input_ref :
        ui-name : |
            RNA-seq SampleSet or Read Library
        short-hint : |
            Select the RNA-seq sample set or reads set. If you have only one sample of RNA-seq reads, select the corresponding library object.
    assembly_or_genome_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Assembly or Genome
        short-hint : |
            Select the assembly or genome on which to align to
    alignment_suffix :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Name Suffix
        short-hint : |
            Suffix append to Reads object name to form Alignment name
    alignment_set_suffix :
        ui-name : |
            AlignmentSet Name Suffix
        short-hint : |
            Suffix append to Set object name to form AlignmentSet name
    read_mismatches :
        ui-name : |
            Read Mismatch Cutoff
        short-hint : |
            Final read alignments with more than this many mismatches are discarded.
    read_gap_length :
        ui-name : |
            Read Gap Cutoff
        short-hint : |
            Final read alignments with more than this many gaps are discarded.
    read_edit_dist :
        ui-name : |
            Read Edit Cutoff
        short-hint : |
            Final read alignments with more than this many edits are discarded.
    min_intron_length :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Intron Length
        short-hint : |
            TopHat will ignore donor/acceptor pairs closer than this many bases apart.
    max_intron_length :
        ui-name : |
            Maximum Intron Length
        short-hint : |
            TopHat will ignore donor/acceptor pairs farther than this many bases apart.
    min_anchor_length :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Anchor Length
        short-hint : |
            TopHat will report junctions spanned by reads with at least this many bases on each side of the junction. This must be at least 3 and the default is 8.
    report_secondary_alignments :
        ui-name : |
            Report Secondary Alignments
        short-hint : |
            Use this option to output secondary alignments.
    no_coverage_search :
        ui-name : |
            No Coverage Search
        short-hint : |
            Use this option to disable the coverage-based search for junctions.
    library_type :
        ui-name : |
            Library Type
        short-hint : |
            Select the direction of the reads with respect to the original mRNA when the library was prepared. The default is fr-unstranded.
    preset_options :
        ui-name : |
            Bowtie2 Alignment Preset Options
        short-hint : |
            Select the preset options to Bowtie2 for how reads are mapped. 
        long-hint : |
            Faster option is generally less sensitive and vice versa.
    reads_condition:
        ui-name : |
            RNA-seq reads condition
        short-hint : |
            Set the condition associated with the input reads object. This is required for a single sample, but ignored for sets of samples, since that is included in the set. 
        long-hint : |
            Set the condition associated with the input reads object. This is required for a single sample, but ignored for sets of samples, since that is included in the set.
description : |
    <p>This App aligns the sequencing reads for a set of two or more samples to an eukaryotic genome using TopHat2 in order to identify splice junctions between exons with the help of Bowtie2 mapping program. Alternatively, if the user has only a single sample of reads or set of reads, this App will take single-end or paired-end library object or reads set instead of a sample set.</p>
    <p>This App also takes a Bowtie2 indexed genome and outputs a set of read alignments in BAM format.</p>
    
    <p>In addition, it provides the alignment statistics such as total reads, mapped and unmapped reads, singletons, multiple alignments, and alignment rate in a table format.</p>
    
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a>, however it can also be run standalone for one or more samples.</p>
